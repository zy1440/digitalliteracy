This is file #1

Man of constant sorrow with a garage in contant use

But then things went wrong
Like they sometimes do
My enthusiasm ran away with me
Which is more than what you did

And she turned to the children at her side
And said, “Take the good and the bad times in your stride”
And, “Abseil for no one.” Then she died
Seems old age killed my teenage bride

So then Ben, it seems every track on the EP involves death, drunkenness, desperate poverty, diabolical dealings, incest, murder and abandonment. Does this reflect your current state of mind?
Well you know I have days.
